      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        High school sweethearts since 2013, we’ve been through so much together.
        Now, after over a decade of love and laughter, we are thrilled to begin
        this new chapter as husband and wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethan is a software engineer, and River is a medical student. Together,
        with our two beloved cats, Puddles and Tofu, we are excited to celebrate
        this special moment with you.
